# TL;DR of ["The Discipline of Creativity"](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-discipline-of-creativity/)

> Many brainstorming exercises that companies undertake fall short in this regard. Although such sessions are frequently fun for participants, the output is too often considered impractical just days after the exercise. Against this backdrop, we have developed an integrative process for idea generation based on approaches drawn from several domains, including education, consumer research, business model design and emergent strategy. The seven steps have been honed through our research and client work over the past decade. The first three steps are designed to help managers understand the problem deeply. Steps four through six describe how to generate tangible ideas for solutions. And the final step explains how to translate the ideas into action. 

# The Discipline of Creativity(7 steps)

### Understand The Problem Deeply
1. **Define the problem and solution space.** (What exactly you’re proposing to solve; what types of answers you seek and find acceptable)
2. **Break the problem down.**
3. **Make the problem personal.** (Encourage empathy)
### How To Generate Tangible Ideas For Solutions
4. **Apply an outside-in perspective.**
5. **Diverge before you converge.**
6. **Create “idea resumes” for a complete solution.**
### Translate The Ideas Into Action
7. **Create a plan to learn.** (Develop integrated solutions)
